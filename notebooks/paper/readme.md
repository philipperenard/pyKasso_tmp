# Paper

``Paper`` is a notebook collection containing the examples presented in [Miville2024]().

- [Example 1](example_01.ipynb): Extremely simplified model in which a single conduit is simulated from an outlet and an inlet in a uniform geological unit. Two families of fractures are randomly generated to introduce uncertainty into the model.
- [Example 2](example_02.ipynb): Simple example illustrating the differences in results between isotropic and anisotropic fast marching ([Visualize results](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/randlab/pyKasso/blob/dev/notebooks/paper/example_02.html)).
- [Example 3](example_03.ipynb): Complex example showcasing pyKasso's functionalities using the Tsanfleuron Glacier as a case study ([Visualize result](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/randlab/pyKasso/blob/dev/notebooks/paper/example_03.html)).
