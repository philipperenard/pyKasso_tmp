# pyKasso - Stochastic karst network simulation

pyKasso is a python3 project to stochastically simulate karst networks.

Version 0.1.0 - April 2020

This is Chlo√©'s stable 2D version as of June 2022.
It contains examples for a simple valley, Gottesacker, and Tsanfleuron.


## Installation

1. Clone this repository and make sure you are in the correct branch.
    - Go to this branch's GitHub page [here](https://github.com/randlab/pyKasso/tree/replace-fast-marching-with-HFM)
    - Click the green "Code" button on the top right
    - Clone using your method of choice (GitHub Desktop for example)
2. Create a new environment from the environment.yml file provided:
    - `conda env create --file your/path/to/environment.yml`
	The new environment will be called pykasso2D
3. Test by activating the new environment, opening a Jupyter notebook, and running a simple example:
	- `conda activate pykasso2D`
	....in progress
	
    
OR:

Install from source (from project main directory):
```
pip install .
```

# Dependencies

pyKasso requires the following python packages to function properly:
- [agd-hfm](https://github.com/Mirebeau/AdaptiveGridDiscretizations) 
	- On non-windows machines or for python 3.7, use `conda install agd -c agd-lbr`
	- On windows with python 3.8+:
		- clone the agd repository from GitHub
		- create a dedicated environment using the agd-hfm.yaml file:
		`conda env create --file path/to/agd.hfm.yaml`
		`conda activate agd-hfm.yaml`
		- install all other packages into this environment
		- note: you can change the name of the environment by changing the name of the agd-hfm.yaml file
- yaml (Note: use `conda install pyyaml` (not yaml))
- mpmath
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- xlrd
- [skfmm](https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm) use `conda install scikit-fmm`
- [karstnet](https://github.com/UniNE-CHYN/karstnet) use `pip install -e your\path\to\karstnet`
	- networkx
	- scipy
	- mplstereonet (Note: cannot install with conda - use pip)

To be able to use pykasso with swmmpy, the following packages are also needed:
- rasterio (Note: this will also install gdal? But may need to do a separate `conda install gdal` first)
- shapely
- pyproj
- pysheds
- swmmtoolbox (Note: cannot install with conda - use pip)
