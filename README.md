# pyKasso - Stochastic karst network simulation

pyKasso is a python3 project to stochastically simulate karst networks.

Version 0.1.0 - April 2020

This is Chlo√©'s stable 2D version as of June 2022.
It contains examples for a simple valley, Gottesacker, and Tsanfleuron.


## Installation
Note: This may not work on non-Windows machines

1. Clone this repository and make sure you are in the correct branch.
    - Go to this branch's GitHub page [here](https://github.com/randlab/pyKasso/tree/replace-fast-marching-with-HFM)
    - Click the green "Code" button on the top right
    - Clone using your method of choice (GitHub Desktop for example)
2. Clone the karsnet repository and keep track of which directory it is in:
    - Karsnet GitHub page is [here](https://github.com/karstnet/karstnet)
3. Create and activate a new environment called pykasso2D from the environment.yml file provided:
    - `conda env create --file your/path/to/environment.yml`
    - `conda activate pykasso2D`    
4. Manually install karstnet from the folder you cloned:
    - `pip install -e your/path/to/karstnet`
3. Test by opening a Jupyter notebook, and running a simple example:
	- `jupyter lab`
	- In Jupyter Lab, navigate in the directory in the right sidebar to your GitHub folder and to the pyKasso repository. 
	- Find the folder called "notebooks"
	- Open the notebook "simple_fastmarching_example.ipynb"
	- Change the paths in the notebook to your local paths
	- Try to run the notebook
    
Note: You may need to install some of the packages listed in the dependencies below if they didn't get installed properly from the environment.yml file. 

OR, try the older simpler install version:

Install from source (from project main directory):
```
pip install .
```

# Dependencies

pyKasso requires the following python packages to function properly:
- [agd-hfm](https://github.com/Mirebeau/AdaptiveGridDiscretizations) 
	- On non-windows machines or for python 3.7, use `conda install agd -c agd-lbr`
	- On windows with python 3.8+:
		- clone the agd repository from GitHub
		- create a dedicated environment using the agd-hfm.yaml file:
		`conda env create --file path/to/agd.hfm.yaml`
		`conda activate agd-hfm.yaml`
		- install all other packages into this environment
		- note: you can change the name of the environment by changing the name of the agd-hfm.yaml file
- yaml (Note: use `conda install pyyaml` (not yaml))
- mpmath
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- xlrd
- openpyxl
- [skfmm](https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm) use `conda install scikit-fmm`
- [karstnet](https://github.com/UniNE-CHYN/karstnet) use `pip install -e your\path\to\karstnet`
	- networkx
	- scipy
	- mplstereonet (Note: cannot install with conda - use pip)

To be able to use pykasso with swmmpy (optional!), the following packages are also needed:
- rasterio (Note: this will also install gdal? But may need to do a separate `conda install gdal` first)
- shapely
- pyproj
- pysheds
- swmmtoolbox (Note: cannot install with conda - use pip)


## Examples

The folder `notebooks/`.
